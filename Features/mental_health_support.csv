Roz subah uthne ka man nahi karta.,"Chhota shuru karo—5 minute pehle uthenge aaj. Alarm door rakho, taaki band karne ke liye uthna pade."
Padhai ka pressure hai rona aa raha hai,"Thoda break lo. 5 deep breaths lein, phir ek chhota topic complete karke khud ko treat dijiye."
Dosto ke saath fit nahi ho pa raha hoon.,"Aisa hota hai. Kisi ek dost se baat karo, ya naye logon se milne ki koshish karo. Sabka apna time hota hai."
Ghar pe sab mujhe daantte hain.,"Kisi bade bhai/behen ya teacher se baat karo. Unhe batao ki aap kaisa feel kar rahe hain."
Breakup ke baad bahut dard hota hai,"Dard hona normal hai. Apne emotions ko diary mein likho, aur dheere-dheere naye activities try karo."
Office mein sab mujhe ignore karte hain,"Kisi ek colleague se chai peene chale jao. Small steps se connection banega."
Mere dimag mein negative thoughts aate rehte hain, "Har negative thought ko ek paper pe likh kar fek do. Yeh symbolic act aapko light feel karayega."
Mujhe kisi se baat karne mein dar lagta hai,"Pehle mirror ke saath practice karo. Phir ek aise insaan se baat karo jo aapko comfortable karaye."
Roz shaam ko gussa aata hai,"Gusse ka reason diary mein likho. 10 minute walk bhi emotions ko calm karne mein help karegi."
Meri neend poori nahi hoti,"Raat ko phone kam dekho, aur ek warm milk try karo. Subah sunlight mein 10 minute baitho."
Mai apna khayal kaise rakhun?,"Roz 1 chhota kaam karo jo aapko khush kare—chahe woh favorite song sunna ho ya ek walk."
Mere paas koi nahi hai baat karne ko,"Online communities ya helplines try karo. Log care karte hain, bas unse milne ka intezaar hai."
Mai hamesha thakaan mehsoos karta hoon,"Body ko aaram do. 2-3 din ka light routine rakho, aur hydration ka khayal rakho."
Mujhe sab chhod kar bhag jaane ka man karta hai,"Aisa feel karna temporary hai. Kisi trusted person ko batayein—woh aapko samjhenge."
Mere pet mein dard hota hai jab mai tension mein hota hoon,"Yeh anxiety ka sign ho sakta hai. Slow breathing try karo: 4 second inhale, 6 second exhale."
Mai apni feelings ko express nahi kar pata,"Drawing ya music se shuru karo. Emotions ko words dene ki zaroorat nahi hoti."
Mere haath kaapne lagte hain jab mai ghabrata hoon,"Yeh anxiety hai. Table pe haath rakh kar deep breaths lo—yeh grounding help karega."
Mujhe lagta hai mai fail ho jaunga,"Har kisi ko aisa lagta hai kabhi na kabhi. Mistakes se hi hum seekhte hain."
Mai apne future ko lekar bahut anxious hoon,"Future ka koi bhi insaan sure nahi hota. Aaj ke liye ek chhota goal set karo."
Mere saare decisions galat lagte hain,"Aapke past decisions ne aapko yahan tak pohchaya hai. Trust your journey."

I feel like a fraud at my job.,"Imposter syndrome is real. List 3 things you did well this week—you earned your place."
Everyone else seems to have their life together,"Social media is a highlight reel. Most people struggle silently too."
I hate how I look today,"When your mind criticizes, counter it: 'My worth isn't defined by today's reflection.'"
My friend is distancing themselves. Did I do something wrong?,"It's not always about you. Reach out once—if they don't respond, focus on those who reciprocate."
I wake up at 3 AM and can't fall back asleep.,"Avoid checking the clock. Try a boring podcast or progressive muscle relaxation."
I nap too much but still feel exhausted,"Long naps disrupt sleep cycles. Limit to 20 mins and check if you're dehydrated/low on iron."
Nightmares keep ruining my sleep.,"Try rewriting the nightmare with a happy ending before bed. Sounds silly, but it helps!"
I set goals but never follow through.,"Break them into tiny steps. Celebrate each step, no matter how small. Progress is progress."
Why can't I stick to anything?,"It's okay to change your mind. Reflect on what you truly want and adjust your goals accordingly."
My stomach hurts when I'm stressed,"Stress can cause physical symptoms. Try ginger tea or deep breathing to soothe your stomach."

I can't focus on anything,"Try the Pomodoro technique: 25 mins of work, 5 mins of break. Repeat. It helps with focus."
I feel like I'm losing my mind,"You're not alone. Talk to someone you trust or a professional. It's okay to ask for help."
I feel like I'm in a rut,"Ruts happen. Try something new, even if it's small—like a new route to work or a different hobby."
I can't stop comparing myself to others,"Social media can amplify this. Unfollow accounts that make you feel bad and focus on your journey."
I don't know how to ask for help,"Start small. Text a friend, 'Can we talk?' or write down what you need help with. It's a brave step."
I feel like I'm not good enough,"You're not alone in feeling this way. Remember, everyone has their own struggles. Focus on your strengths."
I'm tired of pretending I'm fine,"You don't owe anyone performance. Find one safe person to be real with, even if it's a therapist."
